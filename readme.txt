== Description == 

A combination of frame-breaker and scraper protection. Protect your website content from both frames and server-side scraping techniques. If either happens, visitors will be redirected to the original content.

Website scraping comes in two forms: 1) sites that place your content in frames on their site, and 2) server-side scripts that get the contents of your page and insert them into another page using, PHP, ASP, etc, making it look like the scraper site created the content. 

Also some well-known sites display a bar with their content above your content, rob you of traffic, and skew the look and feel of your page. Anyone remember the Digg Bar? Yeah.

Other scrapers just outright jack your site content. Well, that's over now.

This plugin is better than other any frame-breaker plugins out there. Other frame-breakers will only test to see if your site is framed or not. This one will test to see if your content is present on a different domain, and if so, will redirect to the original content's URL. Also, uses X-Frame-Options in HTTP headers to keep your content from showing in frames on other web domains.

Try it and see for yourself.

* Get your website visitors back.
* Retain credit for your work.
* Protect your website content and your brand.
* Improve your SEO.
